# Preserve
Preserve is a game I made for the 48-hour CPGD Game Jam. I have made some minor bug fixes and updates since then to polish off the game, however there are also links to the 48-hour Game Jam [release](https://github.com/i-yam-jeremy/preserve/releases/tag/v1.0) and [demo](https://i-yam-jeremy.itch.io/preserve).

## Game Concept
Preserve is a 2D puzzle platformer. You play as a jar of jam and you can liquify your character to turn into liquid jam. If you jam droplets (jamlets) separate, you will form multiple jars when de-liquifying back into jar form. This can be useful so you can press buttons or fit thru spaces larger jars wouldn't be able to. The goal of the game is to preserve as many jamlets as possible by getting them to the finish. The main idea behind this game came from the phrase "Game Jam". I thought "huh? what if I made a game about jam". And the rest was history. Even the name Preserve is another jam-related pun.

## Gameplay
